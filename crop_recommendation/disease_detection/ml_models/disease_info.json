    "Powdery Mildew": {
      "description": "Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that primarily affects the leaves of many plants. It appears as white or grayish powdery spots on the surface of leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers. This fungus thrives in warm, dry climates but requires high humidity to germinate. Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and drop prematurely, reducing the plant's photosynthetic ability and overall vigor.",
      "treatment": [
        "Apply sulfur-based fungicides or other fungicides labeled for powdery mildew management",
        "Use neem oil and potassium bicarbonate sprays",

      "description": "Leaf rust is a fungal disease characterized by the appearance of small, rust-colored pustules or spots on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves. The disease primarily weakens plants by reducing photosynthesis and causing premature leaf drop. It often spreads rapidly in warm, moist conditions and can lead to significant yield losses if not managed timely.",
